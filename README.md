# ChatGPT-python
ChatGPT Python simple program that you can develop into a project that suits your preferences and needs.

This code is based on the assumption that the ChatGPT API will function similarly to the GPT-3 API. 
But with some differences in how the conversation is structured. 
ChatGPT API is available with variety of models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` families and the latest model `gpt-4` or `gpt-4-0314`, you'll need to replace the `chatgpt-model-id` placeholder with the actual model ID and make any necessary adjustments based on the official API documentation.

Here's a basic implementation of a chatbot using OpenAI's ChatGPT and the `openai` Python library. This example demonstrates how to maintain context during a conversation by continuously updating the conversation history. You'll need to have an OpenAI API key to use this example:

First, install the required library:

```bash
pip install openai
```

That's it!
